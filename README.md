# Registers
There are two sets of registers, **Directly** and **Indirectly** Manipulated Registers (DMR and IMR). There are 2 DMRs and 15+1 IMRs ($0 is constant).

The idea is to use the DMRs to do calculations then save them in the IMRs to reuse them again by putting them in the DMRs.

The DMRs are accessed using `#0` and `#1`,
## INDIRECTLY MANIPULATED REGISTERS (IMR)
| Register(s)   | Description                   |
|---            |---                            |
|`$0`           |Always equals to 0             |
|`$1...$10`     |Registers for general usage    |
|`$11`          |Result of a system call        |
|`$12, $13`     |Argument 0-1 for system calls  |
|`$14, $15`     |Assembler temporaries          |


# Instructions
There are two main types of instructions. **Branching** and **Manipulation** Instructions. Branching instructions are used to branch in the instructions and manipulation instructions are for manipulating the registers. There exists the system call instruction which is a mix of both.
